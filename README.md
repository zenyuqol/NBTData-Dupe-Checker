## Pros
Lots of people have gotten wiped, but with this mod, you can prevent that. You can check if any item you have is duped or not. This uses Hypixel's API to see if it has matching NBT-Data with any other item(s). Also, our use of Hypixel's API is more advanced than Skytils. This means that it has higher dupe-detecting quality, and can detect some items that Skytils cant.

## Cons
It is not compatible with Skytils at this current time. Also, the feature to check if other player's items are duped is currently not working due to Hypixel's recent API changes.

## Hypixel Rules
This mod follows Hypixel's rules in our interpretation. Similar to most Skyblock mods, it is in the 'gray area'. This means use at your own risk.
